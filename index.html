    				<h2>IDEAS</h2>
    				Coming soon...
					<div>
					<hr/>
					<h3>PolyGlot Systems</h3>
					<p>For this we would do a simple project where we 
					pick two languages/runtimes/frameworks and have them perform different 
					roles in an application and share information across something neutral 
					like ZMQ or Redis. Some of the options would be to implement with C# + 
					Node.js/JavaScript + Ruby/Sinatra is a good starting point.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
					<hr/>
					<h3>Persistence Mechanism</h3>
					<p>Where's my persistence mechanism and why you might want to do that. Should I use 
					MongoDB, Riak, SQLite, MySQL, SOLR/Lucene, or CouchBase to store my 
					data? Maybe the best answer is "all of them". How to make that work? 
					Why and when is that a good idea? Lets talk though the design 
					considerations and then do a project that has multiple persistence 
					mechanisms that are well orchestrated to be better than any single system.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
					<hr/>
					<h3>Micro-Services</h3>
					<p>How to build a future-proof system using	micro-services and a language/platform agnostic messaging bus like 
					ZMQ. This would show the process of writing code as a collection of 
					miniature services that communicate over purpose built APIs using ZMQ. 
					It would show how you can use such an architecture to seamlessly scale 
					up from a single process to multi-process to multi-machine. Greatest 
					thing about ZMQ is that it enables this in almost any language and on 
					any OS. To expand on the topic, we may want to consider other queues also.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
					<hr/>
					<h3>Creating Public APIs</h3>
					<p>Creating Public APIs: How to create a public API for your 
					application. REST + JSON? Custom client libraries? C API? Lots of ways 
					to attack this problem. Lets take an existing app, pick a strategy and 
					then surface an API for end users to consume. Lots of challenges there 
					like authentication, rate limiting, shaping the data, caching and 
					consistency, etc... There are some great tools out there for making 
					this easier.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
					<hr/>
					<h3>Continuous Development</h3>
					<p>Continuous Development: How to keep code, tests and delivery to 
					production flowing with minimal impedance creating a continuous 
					cadence of delivering value to your end users. Specifically, building 
					a CI/CD system using TeamCity or Jenkins + AWS, and how to build 
					confidence in your code, tests and process in that environment.</p>
